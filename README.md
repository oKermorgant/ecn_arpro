# Advanced Programming Labs for Control and Robotics major at ECN.


Basic exercices to advanced algorithms that may be done in C++ and/or Python.

Open projects are to get used to the syntax by doing small or less small exercises. The solutions are all given but of course it is useless if you have not tried yourself how to do it for some time.

Sudoku and Maze are used for the assessment (C++ only as it is using existing code).

## Utility script for Centrale Nantes students

If you do the labs in the computer rooms of the school (buildings B/C/D) you should run the `setup_lab_computer.sh` lying in the `ecn_computers` folder. This will set up the lab requirements on these computers.
